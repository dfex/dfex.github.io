My name is Ben and I'm a Network and Systems Engineer for [Comlinx](http://www.comlinx.com.au) in beautiful, sunny Brisbane, where I live with my wife, two daughters and a moggie named Oscar.

My technical interests are:

 * Good, re-useable template-driven network design
 * Automating repetitive and error-prone tasks
 * Optical Transport and WDM
 * Software-Defined Networking - especially projects such as [OpenContrail](http://www.operncontrail.org) and [OpenDaylight](http://www.opendaylight.org) and what they mean for the industry
 * Python programming, especially when used to automate the configuration and operation of network infrastructure - my [Github repo](https://github.com/dfex) is full of little experiments/toys
 * MPLS Network Architectures and Designs
 * Network visualisation

I'm a big fan of [Junos](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/nos/junos/), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx) but as always, there's nothing like the right tool for the job. 

On the weekends, you'll find me:

 * Out in the garden with my girls, tending to my Chilli bushes
 * at the Sunshine Coast, Surfing, Kayaking and doing pretty much anything on the water
 * at pubs with local Craft beer and plenty of atmosphere
 * or enjoying grapes with my wife - particularly Australian Shiraz & Cabernets and New Zealand Sauvignon

If you like talking all things networking, then hit me up!
