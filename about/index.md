My name is Ben and I'm a Network and Systems Engineer for [Comlinx](http://www.comlinx.com.au) in beautiful Brisbane, Australia.

My technical interests are:

 * Good, re-useable template-driven network design
 * Automating repetitive and error-prone tasks
 * Optical Transport and WDM
 * Software-Defined Networking - especially projects such as [OpenContrail](http://www.operncontrail.org) and [OpenDaylight](http://www.opendaylight.org) and what they mean for the industry
 * Python programming, especially when used to automate the configuration and operation of network infrastructure
 * MPLS Network Architectures and Designs

I'm a big fan of [Junos](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/nos/junos/), but I also believe in using the right tool for the job. 

If you like talking all things networking, then hit me up!
